                "description": "College sophomore Tyler Gallagher loves computers, video games, and Thanksgiving Break. He's timed the arrival of his computer components with the holiday vacation from school to blast aliens and enemy soldiers alike on his brand new, high-end gaming computer. When the parts arrive, it soon becomes apparent that they aren't what he ordered from TechTerritory. Thinking he's the butt of a practical joke, Tyler plays along, and builds the computer with the obviously fake components. His annoyance turns to shock when the computer powers on. His shock turns to a mix of disbelief and wonder when he learns the strange \"quantum\" computer can pull web pages from the near future. Disbelief and wonder soon become fear and uncertainty when he discovers the future might not be so bright. \"Search Terms: Alpha\" is the first half of a new time travel thriller. 52,000 word novel Adult themes / language / mild sexual content",

The aim of our studies has been twofold: to examine how the public at large searches the Web and to highlight trends in public Web searching. The eight-year period from 1997 to 2004 saw the beginnings and maturity of public Web searching. Commercial Web search engines have come and gone, or endured, through the fall of the dot.com companies. We saw the rise and, in some cases, the demise of several high profile, publicly available Web search engines. The study of the Web search is an exciting and important area of interdisciplinary research. Our book provides a valuable insight into the growth and development of human interaction with Web search engines. In this book, our focus is on the human aspect of the interaction between user and Web search engine. We do not investigate the Web search engines themselves or their constantly changing interfaces, algorithms and features. We focus on exploring the cognitive and user aspects of public Web searching in the aggregate. We use a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods within the overall methodology known as transaction log analysis.",

We all know how to look up something online by typing words into a search engine. We do this so often that we have made the most famous search engine a verb: we Google it—“Japan population” or “Nobel Peace Prize” or “poison ivy” or whatever we want to know. But knowing how to Google something doesn't make us search experts; there's much more we can do to access the massive collective knowledge available online. In The Joy of Search, Daniel Russell shows us how to be great online researchers. We don't have to be computer geeks or a scholar searching out obscure facts; we just need to know some basic methods. Russell demonstrates these methods with step-by-step searches for answers to a series of intriguing questions—from “what is the wrong side of a towel?” to “what is the most likely way you will die?” Along the way, readers will discover essential tools for effective online searches—and learn some fascinating facts and interesting stories. Russell explains how to frame search queries so they will yield information and describes the best ways to use such resources as Google Earth, Google Scholar, Wikipedia, and Wikimedia. He shows when to put search terms in double quotes, how to use the operator (*), why metadata is important, and how to triangulate information from multiple sources. By the end of this engaging journey of discovering, readers will have the definitive answer to why the best online searches involve more than typing a few words into Google.",

Thus, search engines as the mediators between consumers and online information is an increasingly important topic of research. The present study contributes specifically to the research in consumer search and decision-making by investigating how a search engine's support for topical organization of search results can help improve search performance. Search term formulation is an integral part of the online search process that consumers conduct. Past research shows that the actual search terms used in search queries do matter for improving search performance and also that users often mis-specify search terms, thereby reducing the efficacy of their online search and decision-making. The results of our experimental study offer evidence that topical organization using clustering support, which is provided by some search engines, helps increase relevance and usefulness of search results. The strongest performance improvements were achieved when clustering support was used in combination with terms that were under-specified.",
