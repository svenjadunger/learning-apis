# Library Information Portal Project
Duration: January 10, 2024 - January 29, 2024

## Technologies Used:
JavaScript, Google Books API

## Main Features: 
Easy search and book details display.


This was my first project using JavaScript. I made a simple website called "MyLibrary". The goal was to help people find books and learn about them easily. I used the Google Books API to get book information. This means you can search for any book and see details like the author, title, and more on this website.

I focused on making the website easy to use. I wanted to make sure that anyone who visits can find what they are looking for without any trouble. The website has a search box where you can type the name of a book or an author. Once you search, it shows you a list of books with their details.

Working on this project taught me a lot about JavaScript and how to use APIs to get information from other services. It was really exciting to see how we can connect to big databases like Google Books and show that information on our own website.
